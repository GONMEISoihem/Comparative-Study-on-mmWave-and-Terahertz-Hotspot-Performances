# Comparative Study on mmWave and Terahertz Hotspot Performances
Soihem Gonmei, Junhwan Lee, and Taesoo Kwon

Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology has been instrumental in the development of 5G networks,
and as we anticipate the evolution to 6G mobile communication, the frequency band above 100 GHz, 
specifically the Terahertz (THz) band, emerges as a defining characteristic. The THz band shares
many attributes with mmWave albeit with heightened nuances. Challenges within the THz spectrum 
include reduced antenna aperture size, leading to diminished per-antenna power output, and the 
additional complexity of atmospheric absorption, further compounded by signal blockages like mmWave. 
Moreover, while the homogeneous Poisson Point Process (HPPP) has traditionally modeled the distribution 
of base stations (BSs) and users, it has limitations in capturing the intricate spatial configurations 
encountered in real-world deployments. The Poisson cluster Process (PCP) can capture both non-uniformity
and hotspots forming or coupling in the positions of BSs and the users. This research undertakes a
comparative evaluation of mmWave and THz performance across diverse network topologies.
